# Language Proc Transformer

Language Proc Transformer is a Python-based framework designed for advanced natural language processing (NLP) using transformer architectures. This repository offers a modular and customizable pipeline for training, evaluating, and deploying transformer-based models to solve a variety of language processing tasks.

## Features

- **Transformer Architectures:** Implements state-of-the-art transformer models for NLP tasks.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Provides robust routines for cleaning and tokenizing text data.
- **Customizable Training Pipelines:** Easily modify hyperparameters and training configurations using YAML config files.
- **Evaluation & Inference:** Built-in scripts for model evaluation and real-time inference.
- **Integration:** Seamlessly integrates with popular libraries such as [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) and [Hugging Face Transformers](https://huggingface.co/transformers/).

## Requirements

- Python 3.7 or above
- [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) 1.7+ 
- [Hugging Face Transformers](https://huggingface.co/transformers/)
- Additional dependencies listed in [`requirements.txt`](requirements.txt)

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/wtffqbpl/language_proc_transformer.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

   ```bash
   cd language_proc_transformer
   ```

3. **Create a virtual environment:**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

4. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

### Training

To train a transformer model on your dataset, run:

```bash
python train.py --config configs/train_config.yaml
```

> Adjust the hyperparameters and paths in `configs/train_config.yaml` to suit your dataset and training requirements.

### Evaluation

After training, evaluate your model using:

```bash
python evaluate.py --model_path path/to/saved_model --data_path path/to/test_data
```

### Inference

To perform inference on new text data:

```bash
python inference.py --model_path path/to/saved_model --input "Your sample sentence here"
```

## Configuration

All model and training parameters are managed via YAML configuration files located in the `configs/` directory. This modular setup allows you to quickly experiment with different settings without changing the core code.
